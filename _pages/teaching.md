_"Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn"_ - Benjamin Franklin


Over the years, I have realized that knowing and understanding computer science, particularly software engineering, is more experiential. Students need ways to relate to a concept by applying them in practice. After all, software engineering is about applying the principles of computer science to solve real-life problems. I have been involved in didactic activities since my masters degree at Amrita University, India. Here I provide an overview on my different teaching activities.

__2022-Present__ _Assistant Professor, IIIT Hyderabad, India_

The real academic journeys started here. After I joined IIIT Hyderabad, in the first semester I was co-teaching two courses.

1. Monsoon 2022 - Co-taught Operating Systems and Topics in Software engineering
2. Spring 2023 - [CS6.401 Software Engineering](https://karthikv1392.github.io/cs6401_se_2023)
3. Monsoon 2023 - [CS3.301 Operating Systems and Networks](https://karthikv1392.github.io/cs3301_osn)
4. Spring 2024 - [CS6.401 Software Engineering](https://karthikv1392.github.io/cs6401_se)
5. Monsoon 2024 - [CS3.301 Operating Systems and Networks](https://karthikv1392.github.io/cs3301_osn)


__2021-2022__ _Postdoc and Cultore Della Materia, University of L'Aquila, Italy_

Once I joined as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of L'Aquila, based on my interest in teaching and based on the feedback of my previous teaching activities, I was appointed as the [Cultore Della Materia (Subject Matter Expert)](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultore_della_materia) for two courses -
Software Architecture Course (6 ECTS) and Architecting Intelligent Systems Course (6 ECTS). Both these courses are provided by Prof. Henry Muccini.

__2021__

  1. Delivered technical lectures on the topics of _Publish subscribe architectural style with Apache Kafka, Microservices with demo, Event-driven architecture with demo, self-adaptation, Cloud computing with Google Cloud (hands on sessions)_ as part of the _Software Architecture course_ (6 ECTS) for Master degree students.
  2. Designed course project for Software architecture course based on the Italian national funded project, [VASARI](https:/www.vasariartexperience.it)
  3. Evaluated the projects of 6 groups (each group consisting of 3-4 students) by providing two rounds of reviews.
  4. Participated in the examination committee of the _software architecture course_ and assisted Prof. Henry Muccini in conducting oral examination and further in the final evaluation process.
  5. Provided technical lectures on the topics of _serverless computing, machine learning and self-adaptation and microservices_ as a part of the _Architecting Intelligent Systems Course_ (6 ECTS) for Master degree students.
  6. Designed the projects for the _Architecting Intelligent Systems Course_ (6 ECTS) and further guided students on a regular basis towards the completion of the projects.


__2018-2020__ _Ph.D Student, GSSI, L'Aquila, Italy_

Although not a mandatory requirement in GSSI, I was involved with some teaching activities at the University of L'Aquila, Italy in the software architecture courses provided by my supervisor Prof. Henry Muccini.

__2020__
  1. Delivered technical lectures on the topics of _Views and viewpoints, Publish subscribe architectural style with Apache Kafka and Event-driven architecture with demo, Cloud computing with Google Cloud (hands on sessions)_ as part of the _Software Architecture course_ (6 ECTS) for Master degree students.
  2. Provided technical lectures on the topics of _serverless computing, sel-adaptation and CAPS Modeling framework_ as part of the _Software Architecture Projects course_ (3 ECTS) for Master degree students.
  3. Designed projects for the _Software Architecture Projects course_ , guided students on a regular basis and further participated in the evaluation of the projects. One of the projects was extended with the support of the student and was published at the [37th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium On Applied Computing](http://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2022/).


__2019__

  1. Delivered technical lectures on the topics of _Views and viewpoints, Publish subscribe architectural style with Apache Kafka and Event-driven architecture with demo, Cloud computing with Google Cloud (hands on sessions)_ as part of the _Software Architecture course_ (6 ECTS) for Master degree students.
  2. Collaborated with Davide Del Vecchio from Microsoft, Italy and Prof. Henry Muccini to provide concrete course project to the master degree students of software architecture course. Further supported in the evaluation activities by providing reviews (2 rounds for 4 groups, each group comprises of 3-4 students) to the students.
  3. Provided lectures on _CAPS modeling Framework_, designed projects, guided master degree students and supported evaluation in _Software Architecture Projects course_ (3 ECTS).

__2018__

  1. Worked with Prof. Henry in the new structure of the course with a goal to make the course more hands-on
  2. Delivered technical lectures on the topics of _Views and viewpoints, Publish subscribe architectural style with Apache Kafka and Event-driven architecture with demo_ as part of the Software Architecture course for Master degree students.



__2015-2016__, _Academic Assistant, Amrita University, Kerala, India_

During the first year of my M.Tech (Master of Technology) in Computer Science at Amrita University, Amritapuri Campus, I got the opportunity to work as an academic assistant of the department of Computer Science. My main responsibilities included:

  1. Organizing and managing programming contests (Aspirations 2020 of Infosys, ACM ICPC 2015, etc.)
  2. Managing day-to-day activities in the ACM ICPC programming, Amrita University, Amritapuri Campus
  3. Assisting professors during lab sessions by working closely with students during their lab exercises, helping them and participating in their evaluations.
