The emergence of Generative AI presents lot of oppurtunities to the software engineering commmunity. One such oppurtunity is automating (with minimal human support) cloud operations which involves performing security checks, compliance checks, running well architected assesments, recommending possible actions that can be performed to enhance security, reduce cost, improve reliability, etc. To this end, this project in collaboration with MontyCloud Inc. aims to develop an LLM powered agent for supporting autonomous cloud operations. First version of the product, CloudOps Copilot is now available, [check here](https://montycloud.com/cloudops-copilot)


## Team

Any project requires team effort. The following students/collaborators have been instrumental in the development of different experiments.

1. Rudra Dhar, MS by Research Student, IIIT Hyderabad, India
2. Adyansh Kakran, B.Tech CS Dual Degree Student, IIIT Hyderabad, India
3. Shrikara A, B.Tech CSE Honors Student, IIIT Hyderabad, India


<!--## Key Tools and Technologies used

Below I list some of the tools and technologies that I had used as a part of my responsibilities in the project.

1. Lucidchart and C4Model for architectural Diagrams
2. Python for implementing backend services (Webframework: Tornado)
3. Thingsboard platform for IoT devices integration and raw data visualization
4. Apache Kafka for streaming data from Thingsboard to other services in the platform
5. Google Cloud for deploying some backend prototype-->
