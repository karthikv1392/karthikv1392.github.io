[Virutal labs is a national funded project, funded by MHRD, Government of India](https://www.vlab.co.in/) that aims to provide a platform for students to learn various engineering concepts in an interactive and engaging manner. To this end, it involves developing a set of experiments for teaching every engineering concept. Each subject or broad topic is considered as a lab and inside each lab a set of experiments are created to effectively explain the subject or topic. To know more about virtual labs project, [click here](https://www.vlab.co.in/).

This specific project that I am involved as a Co-PI (PI: Dr. Raghu Reddy), focusses on developing a set of additional experiments for extending the existing [Python lab](https://python-iitk.vlabs.ac.in/). This involves development of experiments for teaching concepts like Exception handling, complex data types, higher order functions, lambda functions, etc.

## Team

Any project requires team effort. The following students/collaborators have been instrumental in the development of different experiments.

  1. Adyansh Kakrn, 2nd year Computer Science Dual degree, IIIT Hyderabad, Hyderabad.

  2. Prathistha Abrol, 4th year Computer Science Dual Degree, IIIT Hyderabad, Hyderabad.

  3. Karthik Konar, 1st year M.Tech Product Design and Management, IIIT Hyderabad, Hyderabad.

  4. Mohit Patni, 3rd year B.Tech Computer Science, Indore Institute of Technology, Indore.


<!--## Key Tools and Technologies used

Below I list some of the tools and technologies that I had used as a part of my responsibilities in the project.

1. Lucidchart and C4Model for architectural Diagrams
2. Python for implementing backend services (Webframework: Tornado)
3. Thingsboard platform for IoT devices integration and raw data visualization
4. Apache Kafka for streaming data from Thingsboard to other services in the platform
5. Google Cloud for deploying some backend prototype-->
