Sustainability  has also been recognized as one of the key non-functional attributes to be considered during software design. However, despite growing efforts from the software engineering community to handle these challenges over the last few years, the ability to determine the sustainability of a legacy or a green field software system through the lens of software architecture in terms of the cost related to maintainability, evolvability and energy consumed is still an open research area. These challenges are further amplified in the case of IoT and Machine Learning (ML) enabled systems due to the highly uncertain, heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the systems. These systems can be broadly classified as Data Intensive Software Systems (DISS) and due to the various challenges related to heterogeneity, uncertainties, etc, building and maintaining sustainable DISS remains an open challenge. To this end, this project aims to contribute towards addressing the technical and environmental sustainability challenges faced by modern software systems through an architecture centric approach.

<!--## Key Tools and Technologies used

Below I list some of the tools and technologies that I had used as a part of my responsibilities in the project.

1. Lucidchart and C4Model for architectural Diagrams
2. Python for implementing backend services (Webframework: Tornado)
3. Thingsboard platform for IoT devices integration and raw data visualization
4. Apache Kafka for streaming data from Thingsboard to other services in the platform
5. Google Cloud for deploying some backend prototype-->
