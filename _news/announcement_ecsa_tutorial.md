I delivered a tutorial on "Software Architecture in the Age of Agentic AI" at the 19th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA) 2025 in Cyprus. The tutorial explored how software architecture principles and practices are evolving to accommodate agentic AI systems, covering both theoretical foundations and practical applications.
