I delivered an invited talk and tutorial on "To Self-adapt or Not: AI's Role in Building Autonomous Software Systems" at the Workshop on AI-driven Secure Critical Infrastructure 2025, NITK, India. The session explored the role of AI in enabling self-adaptive capabilities in critical infrastructure systems.

Slides from the talk are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/iddb5k6eg0nupfw4fiwwt/AI_Self_Adapt.pdf?rlkey=eujcd7naa5zui4vfdxpay6j5h&st=r0qpzh1s&dl=0).
