Had a great week visiting the S2Group at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The visit featured engaging discussions on software architecture, Agentic AI, AI Engineering, SE for Robotics, and digital sustainability with Patricia Lago, Henry Muccini, Ivano, Ilias, Justus, Vincenzo, and the team.

Presented ongoing research from the SA4S group at SERC, IIIT Hyderabad, leading to fruitful discussions and alignment with S2's work on software sustainability, AutoML, AI engineering, and self-adaptation. Also celebrated our ICSE 2026 paper with Radu, Vincenzo, and Ivano.

Many thanks to Patricia for the invitation and for hosting me. Also attended the digital sovereignty event at Waag Futurelab - thought-provoking and timely discussions.
