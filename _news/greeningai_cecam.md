Happy to inform that I participated in the Greening AI with Software Engineering Workshop organized by CECAM and Lorentz at CECAM-HQ, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland. It was an invite-only workshop and was held from Feb 3-7, 2025. The workshop had 28 participants from 12 countries spanning three continents. The workshop was a great success with lot of interesting discussions, talks and brainstomring. I am thankful to the organizers for inviting me. We did click a nice group picture:
