Happy to announce that I have joined [IEEE Software Editorial Board](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/about/13606) where I will be working as a department co-editor for the [Software Engieering Radio](https://www.se-radio.net) Column alongside Robert Blumen. Really grateful for the oppurtunity and looking forward to working and interacting with the amazing set of board members.
