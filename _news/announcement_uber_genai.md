I was honored to be a panelist at the Uber GenAI Meetup 2025 in Hyderabad, where we discussed "Adopting the Fast Emerging Tech". It was a great opportunity to share insights on the practical adoption of Generative AI technologies in industry settings. The event brought together experts and practitioners to explore the challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.
