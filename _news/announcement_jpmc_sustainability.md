I delivered an invited talk on "Software Sustainability: From Research to Practice" at JPMorgan Chase in Hyderabad, India. The talk highlighted our research on sustainable software engineering and how organizations can integrate sustainability considerations into their software development practices.

Slides from the talk are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1tt657clfp7156y159i4i/GreenSoftware_JPMC.pdf?rlkey=7sebti3i30ucz7kaqr4ty4u60&st=m20lc9xf&dl=0).
