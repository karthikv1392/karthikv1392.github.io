Had a great time delivering an invited talk/lecture at the 4th Edition of EDISS Master's programme on the Engineering of Data-intensive Intelligent Software Systems (EMJMD) winter school 2025 in hashtag#LAquila, hashtag#Italy. The talk was on our research at the intersection of hashtag#GenAI and hashtag#SoftwareEngineering. Slides of the talk can be found here: https://lnkd.in/gaGcid3A

Thanks to all the students for the excellent questions and the discussions after the talk. Such an excellent set of students from 18 different countries. Quite an amazing program. It was fun and enriching to go through the different student team posters during the event. There are a lot of interesting and cool projects on the way! It was also nice to listen and learn from the invited talks of Massimiliano Di Penta Grace Lewis and Barbara Russo. Thanks to the EDISS alumni for their nice presentations as well.
