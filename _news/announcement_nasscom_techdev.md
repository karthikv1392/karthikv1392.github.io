I was honored to be an invited speaker at the Nasscom Tech Developer Confluence 2025 in Bangalore, India. I presented on "Engineering Agentic AI: From Concepts to Practice", discussing how to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation of agentic AI systems.

Slides from the talk are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h1gp369xjmlce7g4htc3o/AgenticAI_TechDev_Nasscom_2025.pdf?rlkey=850h4y9pjk9swstubw7214661&st=qco7ck4i&dl=0).
