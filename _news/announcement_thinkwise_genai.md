I delivered an invited talk on "Generative AI in Software Engineering: Perspectives from Research" at the AI for Software Lifecycle event organized by ThinkWise in Hyderabad. The talk explored our research findings on how Generative AI is transforming software engineering practices, from code generation to architectural design.

Slides from the talk are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/2lla0nzx4uzngi5foh8lu/GenAI_SE_Research_Talk_14Nov2025-copy.pdf?rlkey=dt4qmx0gdztzb180x7a1cwi8f&st=mm2rj3dm&dl=0).
