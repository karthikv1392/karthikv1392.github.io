Happy to announce that two papers have been published in collaboration with Mina Alipour and Mahyar Moghaddam from University of Southern Denmark. The details are as follows:

1. Toward Changing Users behavior with Emotion-based Adaptive Systems, [Proceedings of the 31st ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3565472.3595614)

### Abstract

Interactive computer systems’ designers emphasize the importance of considering humans, their emotions, and behaviors as first-class entities. Emotions are integral parts of human nature, and ignoring that can lead the interactive systems to failure, low quality, or discomfort. User interfaces (UIs) are increasingly becoming adaptive to users’ various characteristics, intending to improve users’ satisfaction, performance, and decisions. However, the previous approaches proposed for supervising such adaptations are not effectively adopted in real-life problems. This paper proposes the novel approach to adapting UIs to users’ emotions using Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (MFRL). The approach aims to maximize applying the essential adaptations and minimize the unnecessary ones towards users’ task completion and satisfaction. We chose emergency evacuation training as a suitable evaluation domain since people experience intense emotions in potential danger. We performed experiments with a mobile application we developed that acts as a recommender system in emergency training. By taking contextual input of the users’ basic emotions from face recognition, the application intelligently adapts its UI to quickly lead people to safe areas while arousing target emotions. The research includes literature analysis, surveys, and further adopting an iterative process in implementation and experimentation. The evaluation process confirms the efficiency and effectiveness of the MFRL in iterations, as well as compared to other possible UI adaptation techniques, i.e., rule-based and sequential adaptation.

### Abstract

Emotions are integral to human nature, and their existence, duration, and evolution could lead to specific behaviors. If emotions and behaviors are ignored in the design of socio-technical systems, they will fail or cause discomfort. User interfaces (UIs) are elements of interactive systems able to trigger or moderate emotions. UIs are increasingly designed adaptive to users' various characteristics, intending to improve their satisfaction, performance, and decisions. However, previous adaptation supervising approaches are not effectively adopted in real life since they neglect the dynamic behaviors of humans or systems. This paper proposes Emoticontrol, a quality-driven approach to adapting UIs to users' emotions using Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (MFRL). The approach aims to maximize applying the essential adaptations and minimize the unnecessary ones towards users' enhanced quality of experience (QoE). The approach also considers improving the software quality of service (QoS) by designing software architecture alternatives. We chose emergency evacuation training as a suitable evaluation domain since people experience intense emotions in potential danger. We performed experiments with a mobile application we developed that acts as a recommender system in evacuation training. By taking contextual input of the users' basic emotions from face recognition, the application intelligently adapts its UI to quickly lead people to safe areas while keeping them emotionally controlled. We consider software performance a crucial QoS; thus, we adopt and test architectures that facilitate an acceptable level of performance. The evaluation process confirms the efficiency and effectiveness of the MFRL in iterations, as well as compared to other UI adaptation techniques.
