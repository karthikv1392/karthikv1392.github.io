I got the oppurtunity to speak about Engineering Agentic Systems from Lab to Land at the 11th edition of the TechForward Research Seminar Series organized by IIITH in collaboration with HYSEA at ServiceNow. Slides are available [here](https://www.karthikvaidhyanathan.com/assets/pdf/AgenticAI_TechForward_2025.pdf).
